            Creating and keep track of progress towards measureable goals is hard. 
            Luckily Semantic Samantha is here to help you in achieving you goals!
            When you give Samantha a goal, she will decide on three metrics that
            you will keep track of together. Each day, you can then create a journal 
            entry where you talk about your efforts. She will handle all the evaluation
            for you. At any time, you can chat with her about how your progress is going.
