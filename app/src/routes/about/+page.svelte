                A computer science student at the University of Alberta. 
                This website was created to bring my reclusive command line projects 
                to life.

                I enjoy programming languages, web apps, systems software and more. 
                When a programming idea gets into my head its difficult to get it out
                except forcibly by slumping behind my keyboard for a couple days.
                It is the iterative process of imagination, experimentation, discovery and 
                integration that keeps me interested in programming.

                Writting computer code seems to walk the line between engineering and art. 
                I have certainly felt at times that theese two traits can conflict. 
                My perspective on how to achieve both in balance is to foremost 
                treat programming like a trade which necessitates 
                good craftsmanship. Only after following solid design principles,  
                can the artistic touch shine through on an otherwise purely rational
                creation.
